# description: A Superfluid TypeScript SDK

## Introduction

`@sfpro/sdk` is a compact TypeScript developer toolkit for building on the **Superfluid Protocol**.

It bundles the on-chain ABIs, typed actions, and ready-made React hooks generated with **wagmi CLI** — all split into independent ESM exports so you only ship what you use.

## Characteristics

|                | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Lightweight** | Zero runtime dependencies in the core; only peer-install what your code path needs. |
| **Type-safe**  | Fully-typed ABIs and actions for autocompletion and compile-time checks. |
| **Tree-shakeable** | Each export (`./abi`, `./action`, `./hook`, `./util`) is side-effect-free and independent. |
| **wagmi / viem powered** | Uses the same primitives you already know — no custom wrapper abstractions. |
| **React hooks (optional)** | Consume plain ABIs, viem actions, or rich wagmi hooks depending on your stack. |
| **ESM-only** | Modern build tooling out of the box; no CJS shims. |


## Package layout

```txt
@sfpro/sdk/
├── abi            # Pure typesafe JSON ABIs
├── action         # viem & @wagmi/core actions
├── hook           # wagmi React hooks
└── util           # Common utilities
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Remember:** All SDK exports use singular names (`action` not `actions`, `hook` not `hooks`, `util` not `utils`). This keeps imports clean and consistent!
</Callout>

## Import examples

| You need... | Install... | Import from... |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Only ABIs   | @sfpro/sdk | `import { cfaForwarderAbi } from "@sfpro/sdk/abi"` |
| Actions     | @sfpro/sdk + viem or @wagmi/core | `import { readCfaForwarderGetFlowInfo } from "@sfpro/sdk/action"` |
| React hooks | @sfpro/sdk + wagmi | `import { useCfaForwarderGetFlowInfo } from "@sfpro/sdk/hook"` |
