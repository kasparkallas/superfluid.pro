# description: A Superfluid TypeScript SDK

## Introduction

`@superfluid-finance/sdk` is a compact TypeScript developer toolkit for building on the **Superfluid Protocol**.

It bundles the on-chain ABIs, typed actions, and ready-made React hooks generated with **wagmi CLI** — all split into independent ESM exports so you only ship what you use.

## Characteristics

|                | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Lightweight** | Zero runtime dependencies in the core; only peer-install what your code path needs. |
| **Type-safe**  | Fully-typed ABIs and actions for autocompletion and compile-time checks. |
| **Tree-shakeable** | Each export (`./abi`, `./actions`, `./wagmi`, `./utils`) is side-effect-free and independent. |
| **wagmi / viem powered** | Uses the same primitives you already know — no custom wrapper abstractions. |
| **React hooks (optional)** | Consume plain ABIs, viem actions, or rich wagmi hooks depending on your stack. |
| **ESM-only** | Modern build tooling out of the box; no CJS shims. |
