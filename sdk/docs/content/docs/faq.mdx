## Why a new SDK?

Previous Superfluid packages focused on completeness and abstraction. Over time that led to larger bundles, harder maintenance, tight coupling to outdated specific libraries (e.g. ethers v5), and limited tree-shaking.  

This SDK takes a different approach:
* **Zero abstractions** beyond wagmi/viem primitives — no hidden magic.
* **Code-generated** at publish time; ABI changes propagate instantly.
* **Framework-agnostic** — drop into serverless backends, CLI tools, or React front-ends with equal ease.

## What contracts are supported?
* Host
* ConstantFlowAgreementV1 + CFAv1Forwarder
* GeneralDistributionAgreementV1 + GDAv1Forwarder
* InstantDistributionAgreementV1
* SuperToken + PureSuperToken + NativeAssetSuperToken
* SuperTokenFactory
* Governance
* TOGA
* BatchLiquidator


## Why *viem & wagmi*?

`@superfluid-finance/sdk` sits on top of **viem** (low-level) and **wagmi v2** (React) because this combo hits all our requirements better than any alternative:

| Goal | viem + wagmi | What it gives the SDK |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Maximum type-safety** | Both libraries are written *in* TypeScript and use advanced meta-typing to infer return values directly from ABIs. No codegen step, no `any` escape hatches.  | Generated actions/hooks inherit those exact types, so your editor auto-completes every field and the compiler blocks bad params. |
| **Minimal bundle size** | viem core is < 15 kB min+gzip and fully tree-shakable; wagmi v2 slimmed itself down by delegating heavy work to viem and TanStack Query. |
| **Functional, composable API** | Everything is a pure function. No hidden state, no giant base classes. Easier to test, mock, and compose in both frontend and backend code. | Lets the SDK expose plain functions (actions) and thin hooks without forcing a particular runtime model. |
| **Active, professional development** | The viem & wagmi maintainers release weekly, triage issues fast, and design APIs with clear taste — backed by a fast-growing community. | We can depend on a moving target without becoming maintainers of our own Ethereum client. |

### What about **ethers v6**?

Ethers v6 is a solid library but its architecture differs:

* **Class-centric**: `Contract` instances are ES6 proxies whose methods are generated at runtime, and typechain emits *factory classes* for stronger typing.
* **Heavier mental (and bundle) model**: class hierarchies + runtime proxies; more code to tree-shake.  
* **Less composable** in back-end jobs or functional code that prefers stateless helpers.

**TL;DR**  
*viem + wagmi* give us the strongest types with the smallest payload and an API style that maps 1-to-1 onto the SDK’s code-generated functions — all under an actively maintained, community-loved umbrella. That’s why we built on them.
