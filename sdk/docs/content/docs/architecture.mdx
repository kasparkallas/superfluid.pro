## SDK Structure

The Superfluid SDK is organized into three main import paths, each serving a specific purpose.

<Callout type="info">
**Important**: The SDK primarily exposes **Forwarder contracts** (CFA Forwarder, GDA Forwarder) which are the **recommended way** to interact with Superfluid. These contracts handle the complexity of encoding calls and routing them through the Host contract.
</Callout>

### 1. ABIs (`@superfluid-finance/sdk`)

Raw contract ABIs with enhanced type information:

```ts twoslash
import { 
  superTokenAbi,
  cfaForwarderAbi,
  gdaForwarderAbi,
  cfaForwarderAddress
} from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"
```

Use ABIs when:
- Working directly with viem
- Building custom abstractions
- Need maximum flexibility

### 2. Actions (`@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions`)

Core functions for non-React environments:

```ts twoslash
import { 
  readSuperToken,
  writeSuperToken,
  readCfaForwarder,
  writeCfaForwarder
} from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions"
```

Use actions when:
- Building server-side applications
- Working in non-React frameworks
- Need wagmi's conveniences without React

### 3. Hooks (`@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi`)

React hooks for seamless integration:

```ts twoslash
import { 
  useReadSuperToken,
  useWriteSuperToken,
  useReadCfaForwarder,
  useWriteCfaForwarder
} from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi"
```

Use hooks when:
- Building React applications
- Need reactive data updates
- Want built-in loading/error states

## Import Path Organization

Each import path has sub-paths for different contract categories:

### Root Imports (Essential)
Default imports contain the most commonly used contracts:
- Super Token operations
- **CFA Forwarder** (streaming) - *Recommended for flow management*
- **GDA Forwarder** (distributions) - *Recommended for pool management*

These forwarders are the simplest and safest way to interact with Superfluid.

### Advanced Imports
```ts
import { hostAbi } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/abi/protocol"
import { readHost } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions/protocol"
import { useReadHost } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi/protocol"
```

Protocol-level contracts for advanced use cases:
- Host (core protocol)
- CFA/GDA/IDA (agreement contracts - *use forwarders instead when possible*)
- TOGA (liquidations)

<Callout type="note">
**Note**: Direct interaction with agreement contracts (CFA, GDA, IDA) requires encoding calls through the Host. Use the forwarders instead for a simpler interface.
</Callout>

### Automation Imports
```ts
import { vestingSchedulerAbi } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/abi/automation"
import { readVestingScheduler } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions/automation"
import { useReadVestingScheduler } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi/automation"
```

Automation contracts for scheduled operations:
- AutoWrap (automatic token wrapping)
- VestingScheduler (token vesting)
- FlowScheduler (scheduled streams)

## Why Forwarders?

Superfluid's architecture requires all agreement operations to go through the Host contract. This means:

1. **Direct calls don't work**: You cannot call CFA/GDA/IDA contracts directly
2. **Complex encoding**: Operations must be encoded and sent via `Host.callAgreement()`
3. **Changed msg.sender**: The Host becomes the msg.sender for operations

Forwarders solve these complexities by:
- Handling all encoding automatically
- Being trusted by the protocol (can use `forwardBatchCall`)
- Providing a simple, direct interface
- Maintaining the correct msg.sender context

## Contract Naming Convention

Contract names are transformed for consistency:
- `CFAv1Forwarder` → `cfaForwarder`
- `GeneralDistributionAgreementV1` → `gda`
- `ISuperToken` → `superToken`

## Contract Interaction Patterns

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Forwarder
    participant Host
    participant Agreement
    
    Note over User,Agreement: Recommended Pattern (Using Forwarder)
    User->>Forwarder: setFlowrate(token, receiver, rate)
    Forwarder->>Forwarder: Encode agreement call
    Forwarder->>Host: callAgreement(encoded)
    Host->>Agreement: createFlow/updateFlow/deleteFlow
    Agreement-->>Host: Success
    Host-->>Forwarder: Success
    Forwarder-->>User: Transaction complete
`}
/>

### Recommended Pattern: Use Forwarders

```ts twoslash
// Simple and direct - handles all complexity
import { cfaForwarderAbi, cfaForwarderAddress } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem"
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains"
// @noErrors
const walletClient = {} as any
// ---cut---

// Direct call to forwarder - recommended!
await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: cfaForwarderAddress[mainnet.id],
  abi: cfaForwarderAbi,
  functionName: "setFlowrate",
  args: ["0x...", "0x...", 1000n]
})
```

### Advanced Pattern: Direct Host Interaction

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Host
    participant Agreement
    
    Note over User,Agreement: Advanced Pattern (Direct Host - Avoid)
    User->>User: Manually encode agreement call
    User->>Host: callAgreement(agreement, encoded, context)
    Host->>Agreement: createFlow/updateFlow/deleteFlow
    Agreement-->>Host: Success  
    Host-->>User: Transaction complete
    `}
/>

```ts twoslash  
// Complex and error-prone - avoid unless necessary
import { hostAbi } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk/abi/protocol"
// @noErrors
const encodedCall = "0x..." // Complex encoding required
const walletClient = {} as any
// ---cut---

// Must encode agreement call data first
await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: "0x...", // Host address
  abi: hostAbi,
  functionName: "callAgreement",
  args: ["0x...", encodedCall, "0x"] // Agreement, encoded data, context
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use forwarders when possible**:
   - CFA Forwarder for flows
   - GDA Forwarder for distributions
   - Only use Host/agreements for advanced cases

2. **Choose the right import path**:
   - ABIs for direct viem usage
   - Actions for server/non-React
   - Hooks for React apps

3. **Use specific imports**:
   ```ts
   // Good
   import { cfaForwarderAbi } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"
   
   // Avoid
   import * as sdk from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"
   ```

4. **Leverage type safety**:
   - Let TypeScript guide your implementation
   - Use autocomplete for function names
   - Trust the type errors
