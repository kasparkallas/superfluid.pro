## What is Superfluid?

Superfluid is a revolutionary asset streaming protocol that enables real-time finance on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. Instead of discrete transactions, Superfluid allows money to flow continuously between accounts, enabling new financial primitives and use cases.

## Core Concepts

### Super Tokens

Super Tokens are the fundamental unit of value in Superfluid. They are ERC-20 compatible tokens with additional capabilities for streaming, distributions and composable apps.

There are two types of Super Tokens:

#### Wrapper Super Tokens
- Created by wrapping existing ERC-20 tokens
- Can be unwrapped back to the underlying token
- Most common type (e.g., USDCx, DAIx)

#### Native Asset Super Tokens
- Wrap the native blockchain asset (ETH, MATIC, etc.)
- Use special `upgradeByETH` and `downgradeByETH` functions
- Note: Native Asset and Wrapper Super Token ABIs are merged in the SDK

```ts twoslash
import { superTokenAbi } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"

// Both wrapper and native super tokens use the same ABI
const abi = superTokenAbi
```

**Important**: All Super Token amounts use 18 decimals internally, regardless of the underlying token's decimals.

### Flows (CFA - Constant Flow Agreement)

Flows are continuous streams of tokens from one account to another. Key characteristics:

- Measured in tokens per second (flowrate)
- Can be created, updated, or deleted
- Sender must maintain sufficient balance
- Automatic liquidation if balance runs out

```ts twoslash
import { calculateFlowrate } from "@superfluid-finance/sdk"
import { parseEther } from "viem"

// Stream 100 tokens per month
const flowrate = calculateFlowrate({
  amountWei: parseEther("100"), // Amount in wei units
  timeUnit: "month"
})
```

### Distributions (GDA - General Distribution Agreement)

The GDA enables one-to-many token distributions through pools:

- Create pools to distribute tokens to multiple recipients
- Members receive tokens proportional to their "units"
- Instant distributions to all members
- More efficient than multiple flows

### Key Protocol Components

- **Forwarders**: Simplified interfaces for common operations (**recommended approach**)
  - CFA Forwarder: For managing flows
  - GDA Forwarder: For managing distributions
- **Host**: Core protocol contract managing agreements (advanced usage)
- **TOGA**: Trust-less liquidation system for insolvent flows

## Protocol Architecture

The Superfluid Protocol uses a modular architecture:

1. **Super Token contracts** handle token logic
2. **Agreement contracts** (CFA, GDA) manage distribution rules  
3. **Host contract** coordinates all components
4. **Forwarder contracts** provide user-friendly interfaces

**Important**: Agreement contracts (CFA, GDA, IDA) cannot be called directly. All operations must go through the Host contract using encoded calls. **This is why forwarders are recommended** - they handle this complexity automatically.
