The Superfluid SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the Superfluid Protocol. This reference covers all available contracts, their functions, and usage patterns.

## Contract Categories

### Main Contracts

Core contracts that most applications will use for basic Superfluid functionality.

## Usage Patterns

The SDK provides three ways to interact with each contract:

### 1. React Hooks (wagmi)

Best for React applications using wagmi.

```ts
import { useReadSuperToken, useWriteCfaForwarder } from "@sfpro/sdk/hook"
```

### 2. Core Actions

Best for non-React applications or server-side code.

```ts
import { readSuperToken, createFlow } from "@sfpro/sdk/action"
```

### 3. Contract ABIs

For direct contract interactions with viem or ethers.

```ts
import { superTokenAbi, cfaForwarderAbi } from "@sfpro/sdk/abi"
```

## Getting Started

1. **New to Superfluid?** Start with the [Main Contracts](#main-contracts), particularly [SuperToken](/docs/api/main/super-token) and [CFA Forwarder](/docs/api/main/cfa-forwarder).

2. **Building automation?** Check out the [Automation Contracts](#automation-contracts) for scheduled operations.

3. **Need advanced features?** Explore the [Core Contracts](#core-contracts) for direct protocol access.

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Stream
```ts
// Using CFA Forwarder (recommended)
import { useWriteCfaForwarder } from "@sfpro/sdk/hook"

const { writeContract } = useWriteCfaForwarder()

// Create a stream of 100 tokens per month
const superToken = "0x..." // Super Token address
const sender = "0x..." // Sender address
const receiver = "0x..." // Receiver address
const flowRate = 1000n // Flow rate in wei/second

writeContract({
  functionName: "createFlow",
  args: [
    superToken,
    sender,
    receiver,
    flowRate, // tokens per second
    "0x" // user data (optional)
  ]
})
```

### Batch Operations
```ts
// Combine multiple operations in one transaction
import { useWriteHost } from "@sfpro/sdk/hook"

const { writeContract } = useWriteHost()

writeContract({
  functionName: "batchCall",
  args: [operations]
})
```
