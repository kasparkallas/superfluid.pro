title: Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)
description: CFA contract API reference for managing continuous payment streams
---

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

The Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) is the core agreement for creating and managing continuous payment streams in Superfluid. It enables real-time, per-second token transfers between accounts.

## Overview

The CFA contract handles:
- Creation, update, and deletion of payment streams
- Flow rate calculations and accounting
- ACL (Access Control List) permissions for operators
- Real-time balance updates

## Read Functions

### getFlow

Returns flow information between a sender and receiver.

<Tabs items={['ABI', 'Actions', 'Hooks']}>
<Tab value="Hooks">
```ts
import { useReadConstantFlowAgreementV1 } from '@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi';

const { data: flow } = useReadConstantFlowAgreementV1({
  address: '0x...',
  functionName: 'getFlow',
  args: [token, sender, receiver],
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="ABI">
```ts
import { constantFlowAgreementV1 } from '@superfluid-finance/sdk/abi';

const flow = await client.readContract({
  address: '0x...',
  abi: constantFlowAgreementV1,
  functionName: 'getFlow',
  args: [token, sender, receiver],
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Actions">
```ts
import { readConstantFlowAgreementV1 } from '@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions';

const flow = await readConstantFlowAgreementV1(client, {
  address: '0x...',
  functionName: 'getFlow',
  args: [token, sender, receiver],
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### getNetFlow

Returns the net flow rate for an account (inflow - outflow).

### getFlowByID

Returns flow information by its unique ID.

### getFlowOperatorData

Returns operator permissions for a flow.

## Write Functions

### createFlow

Creates a new payment stream through the Host contract.

<Tabs items={['ABI', 'Actions', 'Hooks']}>
<Tab value="Hooks">
```ts
import { useWriteCfaForwarder } from '@superfluid-finance/sdk/wagmi';

const { writeContract } = useWriteCfaForwarder();

await writeContract({
  address: '0x...',
  functionName: 'createFlow',
  args: [token, sender, receiver, flowRate, userData],
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="ABI">
```ts
import { constantFlowAgreementV1 } from '@superfluid-finance/sdk/abi';

// Note: CFA operations must be called through the Host contract
const callData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: constantFlowAgreementV1,
  functionName: 'createFlow',
  args: [token, receiver, flowRate, '0x'],
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Actions">
```ts
// Use the forwarder contract for direct calls
import { writeCfaForwarder } from '@superfluid-finance/sdk/actions';

const hash = await writeCfaForwarder(client, {
  address: '0x...',
  functionName: 'createFlow',
  args: [token, sender, receiver, flowRate, userData],
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### updateFlow

Updates the flow rate of an existing stream.

### deleteFlow

Terminates a payment stream.

### updateFlowOperatorPermissions

Grants or revokes operator permissions for managing flows.
